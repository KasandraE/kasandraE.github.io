CSS

Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is a programming language, just like HTML.
However, it has a completely different syntax (i.e. grammar)
and it has a completely different function.

















HTML can be used independently on its own;
CSS cannot.  It can only be used TOGETHER with HTML.

HTML is a very declarative language. 
It's kinda like talking with a toddler:
they can only point at things and say what they are.

body!
header!
div!
p (for paragraph)!










CSS allows you to be more expressive in what you say in code.
So you can say we're upgrading you to be able to 
talk like a kindergartener. :-)

body! with a font-size of 28px!
header! with a font-weight of bold!
div! with centered text alignment!
p! with blue colored text!












CSS is written by create a set of "rules" in a stylesheet
(which is basically a document containing the styles
you want to apply to your HTML code/your website)

Each CSS rule is composed of two parts:
- the "selectors", 
    which basically target the HTML we want to style 
- the "declaration block", 
    which contains the styles we want to apply 











CSS Selectors can get quite complicated,
but we're going to start out very simple.

There are three different types of basic selectors 
- ID selectors 
- Class selectors 
- HTML Element selectors 

We're only going to be using the first kind today










(HTML code snippet)
<p id="my_paragraph">
    lorem ipsum
</p>
